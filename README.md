# Mood classifier and facial recognition 
This repository contains the files for a project where a mood classifier CNN was developed, as well as the implementation of the mood model in real time using the webcam. The python script contains the implementation of the model as well as a facial recognition where the user can save his/hers face as a reference images and the model will recognize the user at a later stage. A function was added so that if a individual is recognised but their emotion is classified as 'angry' or 'fearful' the frame freezes for a few seconds and a warning message is displayed.

To try the model out you can download the repository and run the python script "face_recog". Make sure all the needed packages are installed in your enviroment before trying it out, and also make sure you download the whole repository since the script uses the 'emotion_detector.h5' and the 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml'. After this is done the script should work as intended. If you get recognized 'match' will appear in green in the bottom left corner. If you are not recognized it will instead say 'no match'. In the bottom right corner your emotion will be displayed, if your emotion is not detected it will either say 'detecting' or 'unknown'. If you get a match but display anger or fearful the frame will freeze for a couple of seconds and ask you to try again later.
